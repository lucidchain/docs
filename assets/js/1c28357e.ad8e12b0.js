The first thing you can see when you enter the project, is that there are 2 parts very different from each other. The first one is back.

Here you are about to explore back folder in order to understand its content. This is the most complex part of the application. It has a relatively well distributed system that integrates Redmine and ITop tools with an API in order to make them understand and support SCModel and other features. In the following sections we will describe each part.","permalink":"/docs/docs/next/Contributing/Lucid Chain backend/"},{"id":"Lucid chain API/Metrics routes/Metrics routes","title":"Metrics Routes","description":"In this section you will learn about metrics endpoints.
