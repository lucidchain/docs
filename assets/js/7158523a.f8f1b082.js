The first thing you can see when you enter the project, is that there are 2 parts very different from each other. The first one is back. This folder contains all backend logic and the integrations with Redmine and ITop. The other one is front, which contains all the frontend. Here you are about to explore front folder in order to understand its content. This is relatively easy to understand and it has a clear structure. It is a simple project developed in Svelte. The main part is in src folder. In components we can find all the different frontend reusable and/or complex parts. Some examples are issue tables, piecharts and other artifacts.","permalink":"/docs/docs/next/Contributing/Lucid Chain frontend/"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
