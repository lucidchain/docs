## Navigation

Lucid chain has a basic navigation system that consist in two buttons. The first one is a blue text that says ***"Lucid Chain Wizard"***. You can go to the main page everytiime you click on it. There is also an arrow, that redirects you to your previous page in the app. For example, if you go to Import in ITop and then you click the arrow, you will be again in the main page. Another example is when you go to  ***Global Details*** page and then click on the arrow, you will be redirected to your previous page, which is ***Global Overview***.

## Throbber

Lucid chain operations can be slow sometimes. When retrieving service chains or metrics, you will see sometimes a throbber with a message. When you see this, please be patient because sometimes retrieving such an amount of information can take a while. Normally ITop operations are slower than Redmine. This is due to implementation reasons, because Lucid chain operates sometimes with Redmine's Database instead of its API. However, Lucid chain will always work with ITop API.
