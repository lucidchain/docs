# Supported tools and versions

In this section we are going to list each tool version tested and supported by Lucid chain.

## Redmine

We know that Redmine versions greater than 5.1.4 are **not** supported. Lucid chain has been developed and tested with Redmine 5.1.4 and 5.1.3. However, we ***highly recommend using Redmine 5.1.4***. Other versions lower to 5.1.3 have not been tested, so we cannot ensure a correct performance.

## iTop

Lucid chain has been tested using ***iTop 3.0.0***, but new tests are proving that ***iTop 3.2.0 is also compatible***. Other iTop versions have not been tested and we cannot ensure a correct performance.

## MySQL

Lucid chain does not have a database, but for using a local Redmine we strongly recommend using ***MySQL 5.7.*** Other versions have not been tested.

## PhpMyAdmin

In case that you want to look your Redmine database, you have available a phpMyAdmin image in local Docker-compose. ***We have only tested phpMyAdmin 8.2.8***, so we highly recommend using thatspecific version.
