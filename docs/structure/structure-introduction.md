# Lucid chain structure

In this section we are going to learn how lucid chain is structured. The first thing you can see when you enter the project, is that there are 2 parts very different from each other. The first one is ***back***. This folder contains all backend logic and the integrations with Redmine and ITop. The other one is ***front***, which contains all the frontend.
